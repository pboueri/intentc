# Feature: City Generation

## Dependencies
- project/setup

## Target: city-generation

## Description
Users should be able to instantly generate unique cities that feel authentic and diverse. Each city should have its own character while maintaining realistic urban planning principles.

## User Experience
- Choose from different city personalities (dense urban, sprawling suburban, historic European, modern planned)
- Every visit creates a unique but consistent city using a shareable seed
- Cities extend infinitely as users explore
- Smooth performance even with thousands of buildings visible

## City Characteristics

### Dense Urban (Manhattan-style)
- Towering skyscrapers creating dramatic skylines
- Grid-based streets that are easy to navigate
- Central parks providing breathing room
- Gradual height transitions from center to edges

### Historic European
- Winding streets that invite exploration
- Mixed building heights creating visual interest
- Public squares and fountains as focal points
- Narrow alleyways hiding surprises

### Modern Planned
- Organized districts with clear purposes
- Green spaces integrated throughout
- Wide boulevards and modern architecture
- Efficient layout with aesthetic appeal

### Suburban Sprawl
- Residential neighborhoods with character
- Shopping districts and community centers
- Winding roads following natural contours
- Parks and recreational areas

## Performance Goals
- Generate visible city sections in under 100ms
- Support cities with millions of buildings
- Maintain 60fps during exploration
- Use memory efficiently with dynamic loading
