# Running list of broken things

## Markup / Language
- [ ] The language should be more intuitive that markdown
- [ ] There should be a better grammar instead of unstructured text
- [ ] The language should have the same concepts of "imperative" vs. "declarative" vs. "testing" -- just a way higher abstraction
- [ ] It should allow you to intersperse natural language commands with more rigid ones

## Config
- [ ] Config is complicated, it should be simpler
- [ ] CLI modifications should be easier

## Examples
- [ ] Add benchmarks for different coding agents
- [ ] Take a shot at really detailing a full game with full intent instead of quick ones

## State Tracking
- [ ] State should be tracked better and git should work
- [ ] Checkpointing should be better

## Validation
- [ ] validation is really bad if at all present make it better

## Refinement
- [ ] REPL should be amazing. It's bad today
- [ ] implement concept of "tape" of changes and how to incorporate them into the project in an intuitive way


Other broken things:
- parallel builds dont work
- the cli generates stuff that's inconsistent with the code
- testing is probably awful havent looked
